# Advanced Topics in Computional Intelligence: Advantage Actor Critic Implementation
*Author: Natalia Jakubiak*

## Introduction
The goal of this exercise was to implement an Advantage Actor Critic algorithm for solving two problems from OpenAI gym: the classic CartPole problem and more complex LunarLander problem.
This work is structured as 2 isolated jupyter notebooks: 
* a2c_cartpole_report.ipynb - contains the description of an implementation (report) and solution for OpenAI problem "CartPole-V1"
* a2c_lunarlander.ipynb - contains solution for "LunarLander-v2" problem
