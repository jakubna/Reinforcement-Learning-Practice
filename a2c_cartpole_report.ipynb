Because the algorithm starts out with the critic having no knowledge of the environment, the actor similarly can’t learn much from the critic. As the critic starts to make more and more accurate predictions, the calculated TD error (Advantage) becomes more accurate. The actor is able to learn from the increasingly accurate TD error to decide if a move was good or bad.\n",

        "Can be noticed that the agent still gets erratic behaviour instead of a general solution. That is because a stochastic approach is used for the implementation (get_action function uses random choice with probability set as the policy) - the policy is not hardcoded, so there will always be a time where an agent will try to do a weird move. This is in line with the exploration vs. exploitation method."

        "In conclusion, can be observed that A2C is a powerful algorithms that can efficiently solve problems such as CartPole. However, selecting the proper parameters and networks' architectures significantly affects its performance. When the architecture of the network was too complex or the learning rate was too high, the agent did not learn and the behaviour was random. "
